\fBPseudo\fR uses the OS X Security framework to validate the current user\'s \fBsudo\fR session\. Run \fBpseudo\fR to prompt the user for his or her password using the standard OS X Security dialog\. Once authenticated, \fBpseudo\fR will touch the user\'s session timestamp in \fB/var/db/sudo\fR, granting the user or other programs the ability to invoke \fBsudo\fR without a password for the duration of sudo\'s \fITIMEOUT\fR period (5 minutes by default)\.
